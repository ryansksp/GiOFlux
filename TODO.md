# Refactor Client Module

## Tasks
- [x] Add cleanClientData function in clientService.js to filter valid client fields
- [x] Modify createClient method to apply cleanClientData before calling database
- [x] Modify updateClient method to apply cleanClientData before calling database
- [x] Add console.log for cleanedData in both methods for debugging

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests for cleanClientData function (3/3 tests passed)
- [ ] Integration tests for createClient/updateClient (failing due to mocking issues)
- [ ] Test client creation and update in the app
- [ ] Check console for PGRST204 errors

## Notes
- The cleanClientData function works correctly as shown by passing unit tests
- Integration tests fail due to Supabase client import issues in test environment
- Manual testing in the app is recommended to verify end-to-end functionality
